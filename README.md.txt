The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not. The company wants to know:* Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and* How well those variables describe the price of a house.  What is the dataset that is being used?      Train.csvTechnologies Used* Jupyter notebook – version 6.4.12* Python – version 3.9.13* Pandas – version 1.4.4* Numpy – version 1.21.5* Matplotlib.pyplot* Seaborn – version 0.11.2* sklearnConclusions* Since the model accuracy on test and train set for all three models above are similar, we chose the simpler model.* Simple Linear Regression model is fairly complex, hence we would not consider that.* Ridge Regression model is fairly complex, hence we would not consider that.* Optimum value of lambda for Ridge Regression is 4* Lasso Regression model is simpler, hence we would consider that, since most co-efficients are zero.* Optimum value of lambda for Lasso Regression is 50* Most important 30 features that are affecting Sales pricing are:* OverallQual_9                           Score: 44090.81* OverallQual_10                          Score: 28811.319* SaleCondition_Alloca                    Score: -28616.24* Neighborhood_StoneBr                    Score: 27458.272* Functional_Mod                          Score: -27408.595* Neighborhood_Crawfor                    Score: 23028.136* Neighborhood_MeadowV                    Score: -22777.991* KitchenQual_TA                          Score: -19807.934* KitchenQual_Gd                          Score: -19293.312* SaleCondition_Partial                   Score: 18086.014* Exterior1st_BrkFace                     Score: 17443.443* Functional_Typ                          Score: 15927.706* OverallQual_8                           Score: 15336.547* Condition1_RRAe                         Score: -14376.206* KitchenQual_Fa                          Score: -13807.831* MSSubClass_160                          Score: -13204.071* BsmtExposure_Gd                         Score: 12439.447* MSZoning_FV                             Score: 10677.755* Neighborhood_NoRidge                    Score: 10541.689* Neighborhood_BrkSide                    Score: 10172.209* OverallCond_8                           Score: 9456.502* MasVnrType_Stone                        Score: 8633.016* Exterior1st_CemntBd                     Score: 8270.356* OverallCond_3                           Score: -8254.628* BsmtFinType1_GLQ                        Score: 8002.555* Neighborhood_Edwards                    Score: -7815.645* OverallCond_5                           Score: -7740.807* Condition1_Norm                         Score: 6881.349* BsmtQual_TA                             Score: -6532.466* GarageCond_Fa                           Score: -6525.176From our initial set of columns, few of the major influencers for Sales Pricing are:OverallCondSaleConditionNeighborhoodFunctionalKitchenQualExterior1stCondition1MSSubClassBsmtExposureMSZoningAcknowledgements- This project was inspired and was part of Upgrad course AI & ML’s Machine Leaning II part assignment.ContactCreated by [@Shrishtisinghh2000] - feel free to contact me!
